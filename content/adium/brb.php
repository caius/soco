<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Upon the script command <b>%_brb</b> <em>(See footnote)</em> the contact is sent a brb - xxxxx message. 
xxxx is replaced by a totally unbelievable reason for going away.  Just a little joke script I made to 
spice up brb messages...</p>

<p>I'm always on the lookout for new brb reasons.  Anyone that cares to submit more is very welcome to. 
Email them to me -- <em>dev [at] caius [dot] name</em>
</p>

<p>If you wish to edit the script once you've installed it, that is possible, please see the end of this 
page for the how-to.

<p><em>Footnote: /brb still works for legacy reasons, but I've also included %_brb so you can use it within 
a name, <strong>Caius - %_brb</strong> for example</em></p>

<h3>How to edit the reasons &amp; add your own</h3>

<p>Firstly I'd go make sure you have the latest update as I rewrote the script to make it more user 
readable.
</p>

<p>Basically the scripts for adium are bundles.  You need to dig down into <code>/Users/&laquo;your user 
name&raquo;/Library/Application\ Support/Adium\ 2.0/Scripts/</code> then right click 
<code>brb.AdiumScripts</code> and select <code>Show Package Contents</code>.  Open 
<code>Contents/Resources/brb.scpt</code> in Script Editor.
</p>

<p>All the quotes are in the main array (list), { "Quote 1", "Quote 2"}.  The ¬ signifies a continuation 
of a line on the next line.</p>

<p>When you're done, save the file, and relaunch adium to make it recognise the new changes.</p>

<p>Hope that helps. :)</p>
