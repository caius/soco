<h2>Soco</h2>

<p>Basically I got fed up with everything using a database for the backend.  Mainly because you can't drop a database into version control (be it subversion, git or another flavour) without using some export script.</p>

<p>So I wrote my own backend, called Soco after my first alcoholic love, Southern Comfort.</p>
